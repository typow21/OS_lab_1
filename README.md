# Lab 1
Discrete Event Simulator

The purpose of this lab was to simulate how events move through a computer and execute. 

I used structs to make linked lists for all of my queues. For the priority queue I just sorted the linked list. Each node of the linked list was an event. Each event contained a time, event type, and a process id number.
